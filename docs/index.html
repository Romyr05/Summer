                <h2 id = header>Birthday Letter for Zeph ðŸ’–</h2>
                <p>Hello Zep hehe HAHAHA,</p>
                <p>Happy birthday, Zeph â€” to my one and only. I hope your day is just as magical and beautiful as you are. From the first moment I saw you, I was already captivated by your beauty. Hsjdiofhj, I still canâ€™t forget how you looked that day you got on the bus â€” gwapa gwapa sa imo HAHAHA. I instantly developed a crush on you; a very deep one tooâ€¦ Honestly, I thought I was the only one who felt that way, so I tried to hide it for as long as I could. I never expected that youâ€™d have feelings for me too.</p>
                <p>If you asked the me from that day on the bus if someday she would be my girlfriend and I would be writing her a birthday letter, I wouldnâ€™t believe it sfhoushjdf. To be frank, I kept wondering what to give you for your birthday since right now we are currently in a long-distance relationship which makes it really hard to give actual gifts and in the end I actually messaged your friends HAHAHAâ€¦.</p>
                <p>I remember you once said how deleting pictures makes things boring and frustrating for you. And since Iâ€™ve been planning to learn a language, I thought â€” why not make one just for you? SORRY IF DIRI MO NABAL-AN HEHEHE.</p>
                <p>I tried making it like Tinder, but I didnâ€™t expect na may other layer pa pala to actually delete photos on your phone TT. I tried HAHAHA, I swear. However, I still made you a simple website to commemorate your special day.</p>
                <p>Huhu, di ko rin inexpect na bumigay ka sa letter nung monthsary natin, and I was actually wondering kung ibibigay ko ba 'to sa'yo kahit di pa tapos HAHAHA.</p>
                <p>Before I end this letter hehe, I just want to say that every moment with you feels like a dream I never want to wake up from. Your presence alone makes all my stress disappear. Thank you for choosing me, for loving me the way that you do and for simply being you â€” my perfect girl.</p>
                <p>Iâ€™ll always be here for you, cheering you on every step of the way. Happy birthday, love. And just like you said in your letter:</p>
                <p><strong>Letâ€™s grow up together, please.</strong></p>
